## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned



In this exercise I learned how to center all the elements on the screen, using justify-content and align-items. Moreover, what I learned too is the use of images, text and structuring it within the size of the width. The shadow-box was new for me and it makes the QRCode look nice.


### Useful resources

- [Shadow-box](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me to understand how the shadow-box works. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Flexbox](https://flexboxfroggy.com) - This is an amazing web game which helped me finally understand the flexbox and how to place items. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
